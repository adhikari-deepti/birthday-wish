        Yo bro…Happy birthday!!
        
I wish I had a better start for this but I don’t remember when we first meet but I do remember little we discussing white substance can do miracles neither god or just marriage. It can be a maturity thing but then we have Alia batt then Deepika Padukone again Alia batt I don’t remember about sunny di but we have Priyanka Sharma and that Ananya Tripathi and if we are including all the girls we need to include Deepak Sharma to be fair. It not like we are the same you were back then just 2-3 years old and i don't wanna say about Chatterjee how many times he did i admit my defeat but we have similarities too it can be due to our favorite song “Akash Koe “  to our God big bang. For me, my school life end at minu place(may-be you remember) the only thing I get from there were you guys and it was worth it!!. You know I maybe not there in all happy times but  I will be there in your roughest time and I know you will be there too...again happy birthday wish you have 100 more little Vishnu soon and successful practices...</p>
